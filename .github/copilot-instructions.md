This is a TypeScript-based repository for a Visual Studio Code extension to provide Git-based code review and development tools.

## Code standards

### Code style

- Prefer arrow functions for methods
- Avoid excessive comments - comments should only explain "what" for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for public methods and classes, and comment blocks for complex logic
- End comments with a period
